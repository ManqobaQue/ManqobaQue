This Python code defines a simple to-do list application.

Key Features:

Task Management: Allows users to add, view, and mark tasks as complete.
User Interface: Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
Data Storage: Uses a list to store tasks and their completion status.
Error Handling: Implements basic error handling for invalid user input.
How it Works:

Initialization:

Creates an empty list tasks to store to-do items.
Enters an infinite loop to continuously display the menu and process user input.
Menu Display:

Presents a menu with four options: Add Task, Show Tasks, Mark as Done, and Exit.
User Input:

Prompts the user to enter their choice.
Option Handling:

Add Task:
Prompts the user for the number of tasks to add.
For each task, prompts for the task description and adds it to the tasks list with a done status of False.
Show Tasks:
Displays all tasks with their corresponding status (Done or Not Done).
Mark as Done:
Prompts the user to enter the task number to mark as done.
Updates the done status of the selected task to True.
Exit:
Terminates the program.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid input for the number of tasks to add and the task number to mark as done.
Overall:

The code provides a basic to-do list functionality with essential features. It could be enhanced with additional features like task editing, deletion, due dates, and saving/loading tasks to a file.
